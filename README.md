# Automatic File Sorter

A simple Python script that organizes your messy directories by automatically sorting files into folders based on their extensions.

## How to Use

1. Run the script
2. Enter the directory path you want to organize
3. Done! Your files will be sorted into folders by their file types

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No additional packages needed (uses only os and shutil)

## Example
If you have files like `doc1.pdf`, `image.jpg`, and `notes.txt` in a folder, this script will create separate folders named `pdf`, `jpg`, and `txt`, and move each file into its corresponding folder.
